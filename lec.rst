Homework: Choose a paper that combines both comparative genomics and RNAseq to address a biological question. The paper has to be published from 2015-2018. Please write a review, be critique on the techniques used and assess the strength and weaknesses of the paper. Please hand in before 12/29 (one month's time to write the homework). Late or no hand in of your work will be marked 0.
