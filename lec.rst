First assignment (dealine 25th March): 
Find a paper that has a combination of comparative, population, RNAseq or metagenomics in your field (at least 2). Write a protocol on how the bioinformatics part of the study was conducted (what tools, what version, input, output). As detailed as possible.

Second assignment (deadline 15th April):
	1. Construct a BWT of the following sequence ANNABANANA . Show your working.
	2. What is the output of last column?
	3. Write out how you searched the string ANNA
